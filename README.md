# loan-analysis
•	Developed a predictive model in Python to estimate the Probability of Default (PD) for borrowers using historical loan and customer data.
•	Selected key predictive features (e.g., income, outstanding loans, past defaults) to model borrower behavior and creditworthiness.
•	Engineered a prototype function that calculates Expected Loss by combining PD with loan exposure and a fixed 10% recovery rate.
•	Evaluated multiple ML techniques (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) and provided comparative analysis for accuracy and interpretability.
•	Enabled data-driven risk forecasting, helping the team anticipate loan defaults and allocate capital buffers accordingly.
•	Collaborated with risk management to integrate the model into loan loss provisioning and strategic capital planning.
In short, I built a predictive credit risk model in Python to estimate borrower default probabilities, forecast expected losses, and support data-driven capital planning decisions.
